Instructions:
WASD to move. (W for up, A for left, D for right, and S for down), the objective is to eat as many pellets as possible (all if possible) and avoid getting caught by the 
ghosts. There is a large white circle, which is the power up. The power up has a duration of 5 seconds in which the player has time to permanently kill ghosts for the 
round. To kill a ghost, simply walk into it. After all of the pellets are eaten, the player has the option to restart and play again.
